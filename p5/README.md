# Assignment 5

Team: Shawn Zhong & Ziyi Zhang

We created function `typeCheck` for most the the AST nodes except those for some declaration nodes, which check the type recursively.

We also modified P5.java so that it calls the type checker if there is no error in name analyzer. 

We wrote `typeErrors.crrt` and `test.crrt` for testing.
